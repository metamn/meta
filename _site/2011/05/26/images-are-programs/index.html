  Today I’ve found Piet a programming language where the source code looks like an image.
</p>
<p>
  Think QR codes. But here images are color and the programs behind have real functionality. Like …
</p>
<p>
  … Anything. Probably with some development Piet can be enhanced to a level where an ordinary image is a full website, or web application.
</p>
<p>
  Think like this: you have an avatar which run on Piet interpreter displays all information about you: what you are, what do you think, what you did in your entire lifetime, and what are you up to.
</p>
<p>
  Now think about yourself as a 3D Piet program. You run on the interpreter called Life, or Universe and the result is nothing more then your Life and Universe.
</p>
<p>
  And think about Universe is nothing more than a Piet. When looking at, running, it displays itself as we perceive today: what it was, what it is, and what could be.
</p>
<p>
  So everything we perceive is a program, nothing more. There is a picture in where we live.
</p>
<p>
  The existence of that picture is our existence itself.
